#`.zshenv' is sourced on all invocations of the shell, unless the -f option is
# set. It should contain commands to set the command search path, plus other
# important environment variables. `.zshenv' should not contain commands that
# produce output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.
#
# NOTE http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2003/msg00600.html, which is included in
# part below: Some people insist on setting their PATH here to affect things
# like ssh.  Those that do should probably use $SHLVL to ensure that this only
# happens the first time the shell is started (to avoid overriding a customized
# environment).  Also, the various profile/rc/login files all get sourced
# *after* this file, so they will override this value.  One solution is to put
# your path-setting code into a file named .zpath, and source it from both here
# (if we're not a login shell) and from the .zprofile file (which is only
# sourced if we are a login shell).  if [[ $SHLVL == 1 && ! -o LOGIN ]]; then
# source ~/.zpath fi
